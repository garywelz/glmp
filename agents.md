# AI Agents for Genome Logic Modeling

## Overview
Our modular AI system consists of six specialized agents designed to work together in analyzing, modeling, and understanding genomic logic systems.

## ðŸ¤– Agent Portfolio

### 1. Extractor AI
**Task**: Read papers, extract logic from text  
**Function**: Analyzes scientific literature to identify logical patterns, regulatory mechanisms, and computational structures in genomic systems.

### 2. Diagram Synthesizer AI  
**Task**: Convert logic into standardized flowcharts  
**Function**: Transforms extracted logical relationships into visual flowcharts, decision trees, and computational diagrams.

### 3. Pattern Recognizer AI
**Task**: Identify recurring logic motifs  
**Function**: Discovers common patterns across different genomic systems, identifying universal computational principles.

### 4. Meta-Modeler AI
**Task**: Generalize patterns into system-wide theories  
**Function**: Synthesizes individual patterns into comprehensive models that explain broader biological phenomena.

### 5. Critic AI
**Task**: Evaluate and suggest improvements to models  
**Function**: Reviews proposed models for consistency, completeness, and biological accuracy.

### 6. Experiment Prescriber AI
**Task**: Propose testable experiments for logic models  
**Function**: Designs experimental protocols to validate computational predictions and model accuracy.
