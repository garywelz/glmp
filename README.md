# Genome Logic Modeling Project (GLMP)

> A systems biology initiative to model genomes as executable programs using AI.

## 🧬 Project Overview
The **Genome Logic Modeling Project (GLMP)** aims to represent biological processes as computational logic—modeling genes, operons, regulatory circuits, and organism life cycles as flowcharts, logic gates, and modular programs. Our tools include human insight, large language models (LLMs), and AI-assisted diagram synthesis.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build structured diagrams for thousands of genetic circuits and full organism programs.
- Extract and generalize logic patterns from existing biological research.
- Propose and test new models of how genomes function as dynamic, adaptive systems.
- Build a reproducible platform where AI agents generate, refine, and review logic diagrams.

## 🧠 What We're Doing Now
- Modeling viruses as compact genetic programs.
- Creating AI agents for literature analysis, diagram synthesis, and meta-modeling.
- Tracing the visual evolution of genetic diagrams from Mendel to modern AI systems biology.

## 📖 Featured Paper
**[Is the Genome Like a Computer Program?](paper/genome-logic-modeling.md)** - A comprehensive analysis of the genome-as-computer-program metaphor, tracing its development from 1995 to present.

## 🤖 AI Agents
Our modular AI system includes:
- **Extractor AI**: Read papers, extract logic from text
- **Diagram Synthesizer AI**: Convert logic into standardized flowcharts  
- **Pattern Recognizer AI**: Identify recurring logic motifs
- **Meta-Modeler AI**: Generalize patterns into system-wide theories
- **Critic AI**: Evaluate and suggest improvements to models
- **Experiment Prescriber AI**: Propose testable experiments for logic models
